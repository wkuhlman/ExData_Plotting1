# Coursera "Exploratory Data Analysis"
# Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project 1

This repository contains code and graphics output as ".png" files for Coursera class
"Exploratory Data Analysis" Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project 1

The R scripts are names "plot1.R", "plot2.R" "plot3.R", and "plot4.R".
Those scripts generate output ".png" files "plot1.png", "plot2.png" "plot3.png", and "plot4.png", respectively.

## Example usage:
You can run a script by calling "source" in R:

> source("plot1.R")

## Notes:
To save time and bandwidth, I recommend downloading and unzipping the data into the same directory as the scripts
The raw data can be found here:
    https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
There's some code at the top of each file that will automatically download and unzip this file. 
Please uncomment this code if you want the script to do everything for you.

Please see README_ORIGINAL.md for a description of the assignment and a description of the data file.
